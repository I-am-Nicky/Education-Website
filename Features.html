          A round-up of all the ways that features let you respond to devices and preferences.
        </section>
        <section>
          Responsive design wouldn't be possible without queries. Before media queries there was no way of knowing what kind of device people were using to visit your website. Designers had to make assumptions. Those assumptions were encoded into fixed-width designs or liquid layouts.
        </section>
        <section>
          That all changed with the introduction of queries. For the first time designers could meet people halfway. Designers could adjust their layouts to respond to people's devices.
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>@media all</li>
            <li>@media screen</li>
            <li> @media print</li>
            <li>@media speech</li>
          </ul>
         
        </section>
        <section>
          Features, on the other hand, have expanded greatly. Designers now can meet users beyond halfway, adapting designs to fit far more than just screen size.

        </section>
        <section>
          The forced-colors and inverted-colors media features will report whether a device is using a restricted or an inverted color palette.

          A scripting media feature will allow you to adjust your CSS based on the availability of JavaScript.

          A media feature called prefers-reduced-data will allow users to specify that they're on a metered connection so you can send smaller or fewer assets.

          Other proposals are still being formulated. In the next and final module, you'll learn about a proposal for a media feature that handles different screen configurations.
